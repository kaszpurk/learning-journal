## About Kat
Currently, I'm a Project Manager working in the Retail Industry. Having previously owned a small company and worked in Higher Education, I've wanted to learn more about coding to apply that skillset into 'next'.

## Why CodeFellows? 
A friend had taken 101 and reflected on what a positive experience it was, specifically citing being 15+ years out of the education space. I learn quickly on the spot, however, wasn't sure that would translate. 
After taking 101, I was intrigued and had felt that I could learn and apply very quickly.

### What am I hoping to learn from 102?
I'm hoping to have a deeper understanding of tools and applications in JavaScript. I really want to use this knowledge to build a foundation to learn Python.
I'm also looking to connect with a group of like-minded professionals during this chaotic time and learn together!
