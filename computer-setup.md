# Computer Setup
## The Command Line
- This feels like having a map open at all times, help you know where you are and what's around you
- You always start with a prompt and typically type a command
- You must use spaces between command line arguments
- Navigating to the Terminal on my Mac (Applications -> Utilities)
- Bash: Bourne again shell (default for Command Shell)
- Shortcuts are very common, up and down arrow to use a command previously entered

## Navigation
- Commands in Linux are often abbreviations
- ls [options][location]; brackets represent optional when running a command
- *Absolute and Relative Paths*, when using a file or directory we are using one or the other
  -Absolutely: idnetified with a forward slash /
    -Absolute specifiy a location in relation to the root directory
  -Relative: will not being with a slash
    -Relative is in relation to where we currently are in the system
- Hierachical structural
- Root directory is denoted by a single slash
*Shortcuts*
  - ~ shortcut to home directory
  - . is a reference to a current directory
  - .. is a reference to the parent directory 
  - Tab Completion: cd/htab/<beginning of your username> Tab

## More about Files
- Everything is actually a file
- Types of files extensions:
  - file.exe (executable file or program)
  - file.txt (plain text)
  - file.png/.gif/.jpg (image)
- file [path] to find a particular file
- **Linux is Case Sensitive**
- *When we specific a file or directory on the command line it is actually a path*
- *Spaces is how we separate items*
- Quotes: single or double quotations work, anything in the quotes is considered a single item
- Escape Characters: \ 
**Important Concepts**
  - Everything is a file under Linux
  - Linux is an extensionless system
  - Linux is case sensitive
### Hidden Files
- . (full stop) than it is considered hidden
- ls will not list hidden files and directories by default

## Atom: Text Editors
- There are a lot of versions out there, its really about personal preference
- Some important things to evaluated text editors:
  1. Code Completion
  1. Syntax Highlighting
  1. Nice Variety of Themes (reduces eye strain and fatigue)
  1. Ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions
