# JavaScript
Java is the flying bird on the web-page
JS is dynamic: It changes based on user-input
- Designed to make web pages dynamic
- Its interactive
- It is a-snycronous (things happen simultaneously)
Different Data Types
- String
- Boleyan
- Numbers
- Dynamically tight
- A-syncronous
- Interpreted scripted language
## How it all comes together
Each layer forms a separate layer with a different purpose and they build ontop of each other
- html = Content Layer
- css = Presentation Layer
- javascript (js) = Behavior Layer
JS is becoming widely adopted as devices are more web-enabled
Using inspect in Chrome, the code is viewable
> "Most script are added just before the closing '</body>' tag (this is often considered a better place to put your script) ~Jon Duckett, JavaScript & JQuery
## Calling a method of an Object
Object: What you are calling
Member Operator: Several methods and properties
Method: What you want it to do (parameters are inside this object)
> When the browser comes across a '<script>' element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything
## Comments
Call out what your code does, makes the code easier to read and understand and can help others who read your code
- Use '/*' 
## Variable
> A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in **variables** Jon Duckett, JavaScript & JQuery, pg 58
Specify the variables (e.g. *length x width*)
1. Remember the value for *width*
1. Remember the value for *height*
1. Multiply the *width* by *height* to get the *area*
1. Return the result to the user
## Declare a Variable
Variable Keyword: 'var' Example of a keyword
Variable Name: 'quantity' Example of a name
Assignment operator: It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable
## Data Types
- Numeric Data: Handles numbers
    - No commas and can use negative numbers
- String Data: 
    - Consists of letters and other characters
    - Frequently used to add new content to a page, can contain html markup
- Boolean Data: Can have one of two values: true or false
    - Boolean data is very helpful
    - Helps determine which part of script should run\
## Rules for Naming Variables
1. Name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an understand, cannot start with a number
1. Name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or underscore
    1. You must not use a dash (-) or period (.)
1. Cannot use keywords or reserved words; they tell the interpreter to do something
    1. var is a keyword used to declare a variable
1. All variables are case sensitive
1. Use a name that describes the type of information store
    1. 'firstName' might be used to store an individuals first name
1. Variable name is more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of each word *after* the **first word**
