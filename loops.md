# Loops

## Comparison and Logical Operations (pg 150-151, 156 & 157)
- '==' Is Equal to, the same string
- '===' Strict Equal to, compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
- '!=' compares two values to see if they are *not* the same
- '!==' Strict Not Equal to, checks that both the data type and value are not the same
- '>' Greater Than
- '>=' Greater than or Equal tp
- '<' Less Than 
- '<=' Less Than or Equal to
- '&&' Logical and; evaluates both expressions
- '||' Logical or; either expression is true
- '!' Inverts a single Boolean value


## For & while loops: (pg 170-173, 176)
- For: You need to run code a specific number of times in a for loop
    - This is the most common loop
    - This is usually a counter to tell how many times the loop should run
- While: You do not know how many times the code should run
    - Code will continue to loop for as lon gas the condition is true
- Do While: Always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false
- Initialization: Create a variable and set to 0
    - Variable is called index
    - Can be declared before the condition
- Condition: The loop should ocntinue until the counter reaches a specified number
    - The variable that holds a number, called **Rounds**
- Update: Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds on to the counter
