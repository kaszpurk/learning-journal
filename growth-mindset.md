# What is a growth mindset?
We've all been there. Banging our head against a wall, feeling beat down or like a winning team in the locker room at half-time down by 3-nil. The emotions include guilt, shame, embarassment, anger, frustration...**FAILURE**.

## There's a moment
The dividing path of which way to go: stay down or crawl forward. Often staying down is a relief, this disaster is over. This mess ends with a door slammed shut or a face buried in a pillow because you just can't do anymore. 

## Falling upward
*However*, you decide to crawl forward, find gumption and slug through the mud and **GO**. Sometimes this is a thunderous roar of a lion, ready to come back. Often times, it is a grit of the teeth and a **I _got_ this** when you can't see through the intangible cloud.

I call this **_falling upward_**. This reminds me of the [Shel Silverstein Poem](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/ea/b2/f6eab25dbd00713e64e74bd23114d79c.jpg), when your gumption may have gotten you in over your head. When you have the decision to keep going or burying your face back into the pillow.
> The growth mindset is when you are covered in mud, vulnerable, and a voice from inside says 
> *I got* this.

## Staying in the arena

I've never met anyone who experienced or spoken of a great journey, without acknowledging a hurdle, stumbling block or failure. I've been there. I have *lived* there. We all have. Some of my greatest journey's happened because:

### [x] Embrace the discomfort

### [x] What's next isn't visible, sometimes it has to be built

### [x] Build *your* community of support

### [x] Hard doesn't exclude fun
