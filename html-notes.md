### Structure
- Site Map
    - Card Structure 
    - Does duplicate information live anywhere?
> A wirefram is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. ~Duckett 463
- Sketch or draw a wireframe, some online wireframe tools:

### Using Design to tell a message
- Content
- Prioritizing
- Organizing
> By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (such as using the same style for all buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content. ~Duckett 466
- Visual Hierarchy
    - The size and background reinforce primary messages (e.g. large visual)
    - Helps draw the visitor further into the site
- Grouping
    - Information is "chunked"
        - Logo, navigation
        - Contact information
- Similarity
    - Content presented in a similar manner (e.g. icons, header, brief intro text) 
    - Clear what information is clickable
### Visual Hierarchy
> Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding **visual contrast** between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first. ~Duckett, pg 468
- Size
- Color
- Style
- Images
Using Grouping and Similarity by "blocking" content, a site that leverages the brains natural way of sorting visual elements into groups will be easier to understand, navigate and ultimately, convey whatever is being conveyed.
#### Navigation
- Concise
- Clear
- Selective
Once site navigation has been established, understand how the visitor will interact with the navigation:
- Context
- Interactive
- Consistent
