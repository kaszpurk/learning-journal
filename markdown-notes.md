# Markdown Notes

## Kat's Reference
- I found this [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists) quick reference guide:
    - Quick Reference Navigation was really helpful
    - Really liked how unordered and ordered lists are explained
    - Examples were quick and simple

## Markdown on GitHub
- Can take a few minutes to update on GitHub
- Different themes and styles can be used
- Integrate content in multiple ways, photos, links, etc.
